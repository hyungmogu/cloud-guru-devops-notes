1. `Microservices` is the area where Kubernetes really shines

## Microserivces

- `Microservices` are an application architecture
- `Microservices` means building around small, independent services that work together to form the whole application
- `Microservices` has each piece (e.g. auth, customer data, product data, ...) acting as completely separate executable
- `Microservices` has parts with many replicas (e.g. search and product data)
- `Microservices` has parts each scaling separately


## Advantages of Microservices

1. Scalability
2. Cleaner Code
3. Reliability
4. Variety of Tools
